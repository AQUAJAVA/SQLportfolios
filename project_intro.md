# Bike Sharing Data Analysis using SQL Server

This project explores and analyzes a public bike-sharing dataset using **Microsoft SQL Server**. The dataset contains hourly records of rider activity, weather conditions, dates, and user types (casual vs. registered). My goal is to uncover meaningful trends and patterns through SQL queries â€” focusing on **time-series analysis, rider behavior segmentation, and data manipulation (DML)** operations.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze rider trends across time (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Understand how weather, holidays, and weekdays impact bike usage
- Segment behavior between casual and registered users
- Practice intermediate-to-advanced SQL (`GROUP BY`, `CASE`, DML updates, window functions)
- Prepare the dataset for visualizations in tools like Power BI (optional)

## Tools Used

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
- GitHub for version control


### P.S. :- MY FIRST SQL PROJECT

This is my first project after learning SQL, please put up your suggestions. Feel free to use these resources, I will provide all the steps that I went through while creating this project - my methods, approaches, first-thoughts and everything else, Happy learning
